# LiquiCrowd

LiquiCrowd is a marketplace designed for both cryptocurrency asset managers and market makers, offering them the opportunity to borrow funds at substantially reduced rates from crowd-funded liquidity pools. On the other hand, it serves as a platform for investors seeking access to leading systematic trading strategies and improved returns on investment (ROI). This is achieved through the use of smart contracts and partnerships with qualified custodians on a modular blockchain infrastructure, ensuring top-notch security.
